        <h5 class="card-title">What is Speedy SQL all about?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
        Speedy SQL is an easily deployable platform for teaching SQL.
        It runs entirely on your browser and is built with Jekyll, meaning that anyone could easily deploy their own version of Speedy SQL.
        All they need to do is fork the repository, deploy it on GitHub pages, and write a few Markdown files to deploy their own set of questions!
        </p>

    <div class="card my-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Wait, this all runs on my browser?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
        Yep! Speedy SQL is actually running a WebAssembly port of SQLite called <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/">sql.js</a>.
        I came across sql.js while I was trying to port a C++ compiler for a similar project to Speedy SQL using <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>.
        Since I was taking a database course at that time, I decided to just go ahead and make Speedy SQL first while my memory of the course is still fresh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
        As for how Speedy SQL saves your queries and keeps track of the questions you've solved, everything is stored in your browser's local storage.

        <h5 class="card-title">What about client side validation then? How do we prevent cheating?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
        Well, to prevent cheating, we kind of have to deploy the standard architecture: a platform where answers are validated inside a Docker container on the server side.
        If you're someone who can do that though, you're not the target audience of this project.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        This project is meant for educators that cannot afford to spin up their own grading infrastructure due to various constraints.
        Consider high schools and universities across the world that cannot afford the required infrastructure or manpower to deploy their own custom platform.
        Projects such as this, with low barrier to entry (this could technically be deployed as a set of HTML and JavaScript files without requiring internet connection),
        might be the best choice in those cases.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        Alternatively, this could be used as a public learning platform, like websites such as <a href="https://codingbat.com">CodingBat</a>.
        In this case, there really is no reason to care about client side validation.

    <div class="card my-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">I already have a SQL grading system set up. Is this project completely irrelevant to me then?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
        Maybe. Maybe not.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        If you're using Docker container or similar solutions to isolate instances of student answers (<a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">relevant XKCD</a>), 
        you might be able to learn something from this project.
        In my university, and most likely many other universities, gradings are done in container that takes a while to start. 
        So, one answer submission would take a few seconds to finish.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        But, as you can test yourself in this website, without the overhead of starting a container, a submission can be evaluated almost instantaneously.
        You could potentially improve your grading system by opting to spawn a new instance of something similar to sql.js in memory for each student submission.
        This would significantly improve the evaluation speed while still providing the required isolation.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        Alternatively, you could always deploy something similar to Speedy SQL as a playground. 
        Personally, as a student, I always appreciate it when I'm given a playground where I could rapidly test my queries (it blows to wait for a few seconds only to be told that I made a typo).

    <div class="card my-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">You mentioned working on a similar project with C++. Is it going to be deployed too eventually?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
        I'm honestly not sure. I have a few prototypes of similar projects which I might eventually finish, 
        but I'm also considering investing my time in contributing to projects like Emscripten instead.
        At the end of the day though, the aim is really to just improve tech education. 
        I might continue doing so by providing client side platforms or do it in another manner if I feel like there's a better method.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        I also work mostly in the systems area and doesn't touch web development much usually.
        So, I think it's pretty likely that I might just work on lower-level projects in the future, 
        something like using static analysis to analyze code, who knows?
