question: |
    Welcome to the SQL Playground!

    Unlike the usual exercises, the SQL instance in the playground
    is not resetted every time you run a new query.

    This means that the effect of your queries will persist for
    as long as you stay in the playground.

    Have fun experimenting with SQL!
